Build a full-stack microservices application for a Context-Aware Multi-Tenant RAG System.

The platform should be enterprise-style, scalable, and modular.

🔐 Authentication Requirements

Implement authentication using Clerk.

Support:

Google Sign-In

Email and Password login

Session management

Role-based access control

Tenant-aware authorization

Frontend must integrate Clerk SDK.
Backend services must validate Clerk JWT tokens.

🧩 Backend Architecture

Use Microservices Architecture.

Java (Spring Boot Services):

API Gateway

Central entry point

Authentication validation

Request routing

Context Intelligence Service

Extract role, department, permissions

Provide user context API

Multi-Tenant Isolation Service

Enforce tenant separation

Route requests to correct data source

Access Control Service

RBAC + ABAC authorization logic

Python (FastAPI Services):
5. Query Processing Service

Query classification

Intent detection

Hybrid Retrieval Service

BM25 keyword search

Vector similarity search

RAG Generation Service

Context-aware answer generation

Prompt construction

Temporal Context Service

Time-sensitive reasoning

Event-aware filtering

All services communicate via REST APIs using JSON.

☁ Database (Cloud Hosted)

Use cloud-based storage:

PostgreSQL Cloud → users, metadata, policies

Vector Database Cloud (Qdrant or Pinecone) → embeddings

Redis Cloud → caching

Object Storage (S3 compatible) → documents

Use environment variables for credentials.

🎨 Frontend Requirements

Create a modern web UI:

Stack:

React + TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Three.js for 3D visuals

Clerk authentication integration

Features:

Google login + email/password login

Role-based dashboard

Query interface

Animated retrieval pipeline

3D knowledge graph visualization

Smooth transitions and interactions

Design style:

Minimalist

Glassmorphism

Smooth UX

🐳 Deployment Requirements

Dockerize all services

Provide docker-compose configuration

Service health check endpoints

Central configuration management

README with setup steps

📁 Output Requirements

Generate:

Folder structure

Backend services code

Frontend code

Docker setup

Environment configuration guide

Generate step-by-step starting from architecture structure.
